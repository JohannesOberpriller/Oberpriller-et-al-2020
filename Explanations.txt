   Bayesian calibration of a process-based forest model 
                          -
                  a state-space approach
                          -
                   supplementary code


## Subfolder Models:

This folder contains the modified BASFOR model. 
The ability to restart the model, to bias the model and to statiscally perturbate the mdoel were addred to the 
BASFOR implementation of David Cameron (https://github.com/davcam/BASFOR).

BASFERROR: The BASFOR model with bias and statistical error. 


## Subfolder Code:
All the code used to run the calibrations and analyze the results.
NOTE that the analysis has been carried out using two
different machines. Hence the different directories.

Prior to the calibration:
 SensitivityAnalysis.R sensitivity analysis used to determine the 
   most influential parameters for calibration.

Calibrations:
 PMCMC_Scenario1.R
 PMCMC_Scenario2.R
 PMCMC_Scenario3.R

 standardMCMCcalibration.R


Analysis of the results:
 Results.R

All other files are helper functions used in the calibrations
(see PMCMC_Scenario....R) or in Results.R.
