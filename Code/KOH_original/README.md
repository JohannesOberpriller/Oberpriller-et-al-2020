# Running the original Kennedy and O'Hagan method 

Here, we provide a runable example of the original Kennedey and O'Hagan method. <br>
This includes only ten years of data and thus, invasion and fitting are not as expensive as it is for more data. 

The following scripts help to understand the method: 
+ GetReferenceData_add_noise_KOH_original.R: provides the data 
+ KOH_Original.R: Code for the method.  <br>

*Scripts should be run with the source command in RStudio and not with jobs, as working directory changes*
